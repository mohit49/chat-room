# 📲 Voice Broadcast Push Notifications - Implementation Complete

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Push Notifications for Voice Broadcasting

When an admin starts a voice broadcast in a room, all room members (except the broadcaster) will receive a push notification.

---

## 🔔 How It Works

### 1. **Trigger Event**
- Admin clicks "Start Broadcasting" button
- Server validates admin role
- Broadcast starts successfully

### 2. **Push Notification Delivery**
```
Admin starts broadcast
  ↓
Server validates admin role ✅
  ↓
Broadcast starts successfully
  ↓
Server fetches all room members (except broadcaster)
  ↓
Filter users with push notifications enabled
  ↓
Send push notification to each user
  ↓
Members receive: "🎙️ Live Broadcast Started!"
```

### 3. **Notification Content**
- **Title:** `🎙️ Live Broadcast Started!`
- **Body:** `[Username] is broadcasting in [Room Name]`
- **Icon:** App icon (`/icon-192x192.svg`)
- **Data:** Room details, broadcaster info

---

## 📋 Technical Implementation

### Server-Side Changes

**File:** `server/socket/socketHandlers.ts`

Added push notification logic in the `voice_broadcast_start` event handler:

```typescript
// Get all room members except broadcaster
const memberIds = room.members
  .filter((m: any) => m.userId !== socket.userId)
  .map((m: any) => m.userId);

// Get users with push enabled
const usersWithPush = await UserModel.find({
  _id: { $in: memberIds },
  'profile.notificationSettings.pushEnabled': true
});

// Send push notifications
if (usersWithPush.length > 0) {
  await pushNotificationService.sendPushToMultipleUsers(
    usersWithPush.map((u: any) => u._id.toString()),
    {
      title: '🎙️ Live Broadcast Started!',
      body: `${broadcasterName} is broadcasting in ${room.name}`,
      icon: '/icon-192x192.svg',
      data: {
        type: 'voice_broadcast',
        roomId: data.roomId,
        roomName: room.name,
        broadcasterId: socket.userId,
        broadcasterName: broadcasterName
      }
    }
  );
}
```

## 🎯 Features

### ✅ Smart Filtering
- Only sends to room members
- Excludes the broadcaster
- Only sends to users with push enabled

### ✅ Error Handling
- Graceful failure (broadcast continues even if push fails)
- Logs errors for debugging
- Doesn't block the broadcast process

### ✅ Rich Notification Data
Includes metadata for client-side handling:
- `type`: 'voice_broadcast'
- `roomId`: Room identifier
- `roomName`: Room name
- `broadcasterId`: Who started the broadcast
- `broadcasterName`: Broadcaster's display name

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Prerequisites:
1. At least 2 users with push notifications enabled
2. Users must be members of the same room
3. One user must be admin

### Test Steps:

#### Test 1: Basic Push Notification
```
1. User A (admin) - Opens room on device A
2. User B (member) - Has app open on device B with push enabled
3. User A clicks "Start Broadcasting"
4. ✅ User B receives push notification: "🎙️ Live Broadcast Started!"
```

#### Test 2: Multiple Members
```
1. Create a room with 5 members (1 admin, 4 members)
2. Admin starts broadcast
3. ✅ All 4 members receive push notification
4. ✅ Admin does NOT receive notification (excluded)
```

#### Test 3: Push Disabled
```
1. User A (admin) - Starts broadcast
2. User B - Has push notifications disabled
3. ✅ User B does NOT receive push notification
4. ✅ Broadcast still works for User B (socket event received)
```

#### Test 4: Offline Members
```
1. User A (admin) - Starts broadcast
2. User B - Offline/App closed
3. ✅ User B receives push notification on device
4. ✅ Can open app from notification
```
