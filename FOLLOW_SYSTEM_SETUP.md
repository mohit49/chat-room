```

### 2. Verify File Structure

Ensure all the following files have been created:

**Backend Files:**

### 3. Database Migration

The MongoDB schemas will be created automatically when you first use the follow feature. No manual migration needed.

### 4. Testing the Feature

1. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Follow Workflow:**
   - Create/login with two different user accounts
   - Visit another user's profile
   - Click the "Follow" button
   - Check notifications on the receiving user's account
   - Accept the follow request
   - Verify the button state changes to "Following"

3. **Test Unfollow:**
   - Click the "Following" button
   - Confirm the unfollow action in the dialog
   - Verify the button returns to "Follow" state

4. **Test Followers/Following List:**
   - On your profile page, click on the followers/following count
   - Verify the dialog opens with tabs
   - Click on a user to navigate to their profile
   - Test the unfollow button in the following tab

### 5. Socket Events Testing

Open two browser tabs with different logged-in users:
1. Send a follow request from Tab 1
2. Verify real-time toast notification appears in Tab 2
3. Accept the request in Tab 2
4. Verify acceptance notification appears in Tab 1

- Check notification permissions in browser
- Ensure GlobalFollowListener is mounted in layout

**Issue: Toast notifications missing**
- Run `npm install @radix-ui/react-toast`

**Issue: Database errors**
- Ensure MongoDB is running
- Check connection string in environment variables
