## üîí HTTPS Requirement

### **CRITICAL: Voice broadcasting REQUIRES HTTPS in production!**

| Environment | Microphone Access | Broadcasting |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **localhost** | ‚úÖ Works | ‚úÖ Works |
| **HTTP (network/domain)** | ‚ùå BLOCKED | ‚ùå Won't work |
| **HTTPS** | ‚úÖ Works | ‚úÖ Works |

### Why HTTPS is Required:
- Browser security policy blocks `getUserMedia()` on insecure contexts
- WebRTC APIs require secure context
- Only localhost is exempt from this requirement

---

## üöÄ Setup for Production

### **Option 1: Local Network (Development/Testing)**

**Works without HTTPS on localhost:**
```bash
npm run dev
# Access via: http://localhost:3000
```

‚úÖ Broadcasting will work
‚úÖ All features functional

### **Option 2: Production Deployment with HTTPS**

**Required for network/domain access:**

1. **Get SSL Certificate**
   - Use Let's Encrypt (free)
   - Or use Cloudflare SSL
   - Or use your hosting provider's SSL

2. **Configure Server**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   USE_HTTPS=true
   DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
   ```

3. **Build and Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run build:prod
   npm run start:domain
   ```

4. **Access via HTTPS**
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com
   ```

‚úÖ Broadcasting will work
‚úÖ All features functional

## üîß Technical Details

### **Audio Streaming Flow:**

```
Admin's Browser:
1. getUserMedia() ‚Üí Capture microphone
2. AudioContext ‚Üí Process audio
3. ScriptProcessor ‚Üí Extract audio data
4. Socket.emit('audio_stream') ‚Üí Send to server

Server:
5. Receive audio_stream event
6. socket.to(`room_${roomId}`) ‚Üí Relay to all room members

Listener's Browser:
7. Receive audio_stream event
8. AudioContext ‚Üí Create audio buffer
9. BufferSource ‚Üí Play audio chunks
10. Speakers ‚Üí Output sound
```

### **Audio Quality Settings:**
- **Sample Rate**: 48kHz
- **Buffer Size**: 4096 samples
- **Channels**: Mono (1 channel)
- **Processing**: Echo cancellation, noise suppression, auto gain

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **"Failed to start voice broadcast"**

**Possible causes:**
1. **Not using HTTPS** (most common)
   - ‚úÖ Solution: Deploy with HTTPS or use localhost

2. **Microphone permission denied**
   - ‚úÖ Solution: Allow microphone in browser settings

3. **No microphone connected**
   - ‚úÖ Solution: Connect a microphone device

4. **Browser not supported**
   - ‚úÖ Solution: Use Chrome, Firefox, or Safari (latest versions)

### **"Receiver can't hear audio"**

**Check:**
1. ‚úÖ Is receiver in the same room?
2. ‚úÖ Is receiver's browser on HTTPS or localhost?
3. ‚úÖ Is receiver's volume not muted?
4. ‚úÖ Did receiver click Play (if paused)?
5. ‚úÖ Check browser console for errors

### **"Green strip doesn't appear"**

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page - broadcast state will restore
2. Join the room chat - triggers broadcast status check
3. Check socket connection status
4. Verify you're a member of the room

## üåê Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Version | Support |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Chrome | 80+ | ‚úÖ Full support |

## üìä Console Log Suppression

### **Automatic in Production**

**Frontend (Next.js):**
- All `console.log()` removed during build
- `console.error()` and `console.warn()` kept
- Configured in `next.config.ts`

**Backend (Node.js):**
- `console.log()` suppressed at runtime
- `console.error()` and `console.warn()` kept
- Configured in `server/utils/logger.ts`

**Build for production:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm run build
NODE_ENV=production npm run server:prod
```

## üéØ Quick Setup Checklist

- [ ] SSL certificate installed
- [ ] HTTPS configured on server
- [ ] Domain pointing to server
- [ ] Firewall allows HTTPS (port 443)
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Built with production flag
- [ ] Tested microphone access
- [ ] Verified socket connection

## üí° Tips

1. **Test on localhost first** - No HTTPS needed
2. **Use Let's Encrypt** - Free SSL certificates
3. **Check browser console** - Shows permission errors
4. **Grant microphone access** - Required for broadcasting
5. **Use headphones** - Prevents audio feedback for listeners
